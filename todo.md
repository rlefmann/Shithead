# TODO list

## Gameplay


## Cursor

* If you can't switch the group, the cursor jumps to position 0 of the current group
* Use an unorderedDict to access the groups more intuitively

## CardSpriteGroups

* Discardpile doesn not disappear when it contains no more cards
* Hidden Card sprites cannot be highlighted

## Other

* cursor methods should not be called from the controller but only within the view
