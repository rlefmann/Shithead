## Deal

Each player gets dealt:

* a row of three face-down cards
* three face-up cards, each on top of one of the downcards
* an equal amount of face-down hand cards

The remaining cards are placed face down to form a draw pile.

## Play

The first player is the person with the lowest non-special card in their
hand. The cards rank from lowest to highest are 2,3,...,10,J,Q,K,A.
If the rank of the lowest cards of two or more players is the same, the 
suits of those cards are compared: diamonds is the lowest, followed by
hearts, spades, and clubs. Typically the lowest card is the four of diamonds.
